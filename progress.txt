# Build Progress Log

## Task 1 - 2026-02-21
### Completed: Migrate to Dynamic v2/v3 Base URL

**What was implemented:**
- Changed `defaultBaseURL` from `https://api.clickup.com/api/v2` to `https://api.clickup.com/api` in both `api/client.go` and `clickup/client.go`
- Updated ALL existing service method paths to include `/v2/` prefix (e.g., `/task/{id}` → `/v2/task/{id}`)
- Added `workspaceID` field to `clickup.Client` struct
- Added `ClientOption` functional options pattern for configuring the client
- Added `WithWorkspaceID` option for future v3 endpoint support
- Added `v3Path()` helper method to build v3 API paths with workspace ID prefix
- Added `Patch()` method to `api.Client` for v3 PATCH endpoints
- Added `PostMultipart()` method to `api.Client` for file upload endpoints
- Added comprehensive tests for all new functionality:
  - `TestV3Path_BuildsCorrectPath` - verifies v3 path construction
  - `TestV3Path_MissingWorkspaceID` - verifies error handling for missing workspace ID
  - `TestPatch_SendsJSONBody` - verifies PATCH method sends correct HTTP method and body
  - `TestPatch_PropagatesAPIError` - verifies PATCH error handling
  - `TestPostMultipart_SendsFile` - verifies multipart file upload
  - `TestPostMultipart_SetsAuthHeader` - verifies auth header is set
  - `TestPostMultipart_PropagatesAPIError` - verifies multipart error handling
  - `TestBaseURLConstruction` - verifies new base URL structure

**Files changed:**
- `internal/api/client.go` — modified (base URL, Patch, PostMultipart methods)
- `internal/api/client_test.go` — modified (added tests for Patch, PostMultipart, base URL)
- `internal/clickup/client.go` — modified (base URL, workspaceID, v3Path helper, all paths with /v2/)
- `internal/clickup/client_test.go` — modified (v3Path tests, updated path expectations)
- `internal/clickup/types.go` — minor formatting fixes from linter

**Branch:** `phase/1-foundation`
**Commit:** `086de16`

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The linter (wsl_v5) requires blank lines before return statements after if/else blocks
- Variable shadowing (`err`) triggers govet shadow check - use different variable names
- The `make ci` target runs `fmt-check` which checks for uncommitted changes - must commit before passing
- Functional options pattern is the idiomatic way to configure clients in Go

## Task 2 - 2026-02-21
### Completed: Add Workspace ID Configuration

**What was implemented:**
- Added `--workspace` global flag to CLI root command with help text explaining it's required for v3 API
- Added `CLICKUP_WORKSPACE_ID` environment variable support via Kong vars binding
- Added workspace ID to config file (`config.json`) with `GetWorkspaceID()` and `SetWorkspaceID()` functions
- Updated `getClickUpClient()` to resolve workspace ID from: context (flag) > env var > config
- Added `withWorkspaceID()` and `getWorkspaceIDFromContext()` helpers to pass workspace ID via context
- Added `auth set-workspace` command to configure workspace ID
- Updated `auth status` command to display workspace ID configuration status
- Workspace ID is passed to the ClickUp client via `WithWorkspaceID()` option (implemented in Task 1)

**Files changed:**
- `internal/cmd/root.go` — modified (added Workspace flag, workspace context helpers, kong vars)
- `internal/cmd/helpers.go` — modified (getClickUpClient now takes context, resolves workspace ID)
- `internal/cmd/auth.go` — modified (added AuthSetWorkspaceCmd, updated AuthStatusCmd)
- `internal/config/config.go` — modified (added WorkspaceID to configData, GetWorkspaceID, SetWorkspaceID)
- All command files (tasks.go, comments.go, members.go, lists.go, time.go, spaces.go) — updated to pass context to getClickUpClient

**Branch:** `phase/1-foundation`

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When adding global flags to Kong CLI, do NOT embed RootFlags in subcommands - it creates duplicate flags
- Use context to pass global flag values down to helper functions instead of adding fields to every command struct
- The Kong vars mechanism allows environment variable defaults for flags via `${varname}` syntax in default tag
- Workspace ID is optional for v2 endpoints - only v3 endpoints require it (error handled in v3Path helper from Task 1)

## Task 3 - 2026-02-21
### Completed: Add Contract Tests for v3 Infrastructure

**What was implemented:**
- Contract tests for v3 infrastructure were already implemented as part of Tasks 1 and 2
- Tests verify:
  - `TestBaseURLConstruction` - base URL construction for v2 paths
  - `TestV3Path_BuildsCorrectPath` - v3Path helper builds correct workspace-prefixed paths
  - `TestV3Path_MissingWorkspaceID` - error handling for missing workspace ID
  - `TestPatch_SendsJSONBody` - PATCH method sends correct HTTP method and JSON body
  - `TestPatch_PropagatesAPIError` - PATCH error handling matches existing patterns
  - `TestPostMultipart_SendsFile` - multipart file upload with correct content type
  - `TestPostMultipart_SetsAuthHeader` - auth header set on multipart requests
  - `TestPostMultipart_PropagatesAPIError` - multipart error handling

**Files changed:**
- No new files - tests were already in place from Tasks 1 and 2

**Branch:** `phase/1-foundation`
**PR URL:** (pending - Phase 1 complete, ready for PR creation)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When implementing infrastructure changes, include tests as part of the same task for atomic verification
- The spec recommended separate test task, but implementing tests alongside infrastructure is more efficient

## Phase 1 Complete

All 3 foundation architecture tasks are complete:
1. ✅ Migrate to Dynamic v2/v3 Base URL
2. ✅ Add Workspace ID Configuration
3. ✅ Add Contract Tests for v3 Infrastructure

Next: Open PR from `phase/1-foundation` to `fix/plain-output`, then start Phase 2 (Workspaces & Authorization)
