# Build Progress Log

## Task 1 - 2026-02-21
### Completed: Migrate to Dynamic v2/v3 Base URL

**What was implemented:**
- Changed `defaultBaseURL` from `https://api.clickup.com/api/v2` to `https://api.clickup.com/api` in both `api/client.go` and `clickup/client.go`
- Updated ALL existing service method paths to include `/v2/` prefix (e.g., `/task/{id}` → `/v2/task/{id}`)
- Added `workspaceID` field to `clickup.Client` struct
- Added `ClientOption` functional options pattern for configuring the client
- Added `WithWorkspaceID` option for future v3 endpoint support
- Added `v3Path()` helper method to build v3 API paths with workspace ID prefix
- Added `Patch()` method to `api.Client` for v3 PATCH endpoints
- Added `PostMultipart()` method to `api.Client` for file upload endpoints
- Added comprehensive tests for all new functionality:
  - `TestV3Path_BuildsCorrectPath` - verifies v3 path construction
  - `TestV3Path_MissingWorkspaceID` - verifies error handling for missing workspace ID
  - `TestPatch_SendsJSONBody` - verifies PATCH method sends correct HTTP method and body
  - `TestPatch_PropagatesAPIError` - verifies PATCH error handling
  - `TestPostMultipart_SendsFile` - verifies multipart file upload
  - `TestPostMultipart_SetsAuthHeader` - verifies auth header is set
  - `TestPostMultipart_PropagatesAPIError` - verifies multipart error handling
  - `TestBaseURLConstruction` - verifies new base URL structure

**Files changed:**
- `internal/api/client.go` — modified (base URL, Patch, PostMultipart methods)
- `internal/api/client_test.go` — modified (added tests for Patch, PostMultipart, base URL)
- `internal/clickup/client.go` — modified (base URL, workspaceID, v3Path helper, all paths with /v2/)
- `internal/clickup/client_test.go` — modified (v3Path tests, updated path expectations)
- `internal/clickup/types.go` — minor formatting fixes from linter

**Branch:** `phase/1-foundation`
**Commit:** `086de16`

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The linter (wsl_v5) requires blank lines before return statements after if/else blocks
- Variable shadowing (`err`) triggers govet shadow check - use different variable names
- The `make ci` target runs `fmt-check` which checks for uncommitted changes - must commit before passing
- Functional options pattern is the idiomatic way to configure clients in Go

---

## Task 2 - 2026-02-21
### Completed: Add Workspace ID Configuration

**What was implemented:**
- Added `--workspace` global flag to CLI root command with help text explaining it's required for v3 API
- Added `CLICKUP_WORKSPACE_ID` environment variable support via Kong vars binding
- Added workspace ID to config file (`config.json`) with `GetWorkspaceID()` and `SetWorkspaceID()` functions
- Updated `getClickUpClient()` to resolve workspace ID from: context (flag) > env var > config
- Added `withWorkspaceID()` and `getWorkspaceIDFromContext()` helpers to pass workspace ID via context
- Added `auth set-workspace` command to configure workspace ID
- Updated `auth status` command to display workspace ID configuration status
- Workspace ID is passed to the ClickUp client via `WithWorkspaceID()` option (implemented in Task 1)

**Files changed:**
- `internal/cmd/root.go` — modified (added Workspace flag, workspace context helpers, kong vars)
- `internal/cmd/helpers.go` — modified (getClickUpClient now takes context, resolves workspace ID)
- `internal/cmd/auth.go` — modified (added AuthSetWorkspaceCmd, updated AuthStatusCmd)
- `internal/config/config.go` — modified (added WorkspaceID to configData, GetWorkspaceID, SetWorkspaceID)
- All command files (tasks.go, comments.go, members.go, lists.go, time.go, spaces.go) — updated to pass context to getClickUpClient

**Branch:** `phase/1-foundation`

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When adding global flags to Kong CLI, do NOT embed RootFlags in subcommands - it creates duplicate flags
- Use context to pass global flag values down to helper functions instead of adding fields to every command struct
- The Kong vars mechanism allows environment variable defaults for flags via `${varname}` syntax in default tag
- Workspace ID is optional for v2 endpoints - only v3 endpoints require it (error handled in v3Path helper from Task 1)

---

## Task 3 - 2026-02-21
### Completed: Add Contract Tests for v3 Infrastructure

**What was implemented:**
- Contract tests for v3 infrastructure were already implemented as part of Tasks 1 and 2
- Tests verify:
  - `TestBaseURLConstruction` - base URL construction for v2 paths
  - `TestV3Path_BuildsCorrectPath` - v3Path helper builds correct workspace-prefixed paths
  - `TestV3Path_MissingWorkspaceID` - error handling for missing workspace ID
  - `TestPatch_SendsJSONBody` - PATCH method sends correct HTTP method and JSON body
  - `TestPatch_PropagatesAPIError` - PATCH error handling matches existing patterns
  - `TestPostMultipart_SendsFile` - multipart file upload with correct content type
  - `TestPostMultipart_SetsAuthHeader` - auth header set on multipart requests
  - `TestPostMultipart_PropagatesAPIError` - multipart error handling

**Files changed:**
- No new files - tests were already in place from Tasks 1 and 2

**Branch:** `phase/1-foundation`
**PR URL:** (pending - Phase 1 complete, ready for PR creation)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When implementing infrastructure changes, include tests as part of the same task for atomic verification
- The spec recommended separate test task, but implementing tests alongside infrastructure is more efficient

---

- `internal/clickup/types.go` — added FolderDetail and related types
- `internal/clickup/client_test.go` — added 6 tests for Folders service
- `internal/cmd/folders.go` — created with all CLI commands
- `internal/cmd/root.go` — added FoldersCmd to CLI struct

**Branch:** `phase/9-p2-completeness`
**Commit:** `258bb61`
**PR URL:** https://github.com/Robben-Media/clickup-cli/pull/16

**Learnings:**
- Folder `task_count` is returned as string, not number (API quirk)
- Deleting a folder moves its lists to folderless, doesn't delete them
- Template creation endpoint requires space ID AND template ID

## Task 9 - 2026-02-22
### Completed: Extend Tasks Service (Search, Time-in-Status, Merge, Move)

**What was implemented:**
- Extended `TasksService` with Search, TimeInStatus, BulkTimeInStatus, Merge, Move, CreateFromTemplate methods
- Implemented `GET /v2/team/{team_id}/task` (GetFilteredTeamTasks - workspace search with filters)
- Implemented `GET /v2/task/{task_id}/time_in_status` (time in status for single task)
- Implemented `GET /v2/task/bulk_time_in_status/task_ids` (bulk time in status)
- Implemented `POST /v2/task/{task_id}/merge` (merge tasks)
- Implemented `PUT /v3/workspaces/{workspace_id}/tasks/{task_id}/home_list/{list_id}` (move task - v3)
- Implemented `POST /v2/list/{list_id}/taskTemplate/{template_id}` (create from template)
- Added types: FilteredTeamTasksParams, FilteredTeamTasksResponse, TimeInStatusResponse, StatusTime, TimeValue, BulkTimeInStatusResponse, MergeTasksRequest, MergeTasksResponse, MoveTaskResponse, CreateTaskFromTemplateRequest
- Added CLI commands: tasks search, time-in-status, bulk-time-in-status, merge, move, from-template
- Added 16 comprehensive tests for all new service methods
- Added static error variables: errTaskIDRequired, errSourceTaskIDRequired

**Files changed:**
- `internal/clickup/client.go` — extended TasksService with all new methods
- `internal/clickup/types.go` — added all Task extension types
- `internal/clickup/client_test.go` — added 16 tests for new methods
- `internal/cmd/tasks.go` — added all new CLI commands with output formatting

**Branch:** `phase/9-p2-completeness`
**Commit:** `abd68e5`
**PR URL:** https://github.com/Robben-Media/clickup-cli/pull/16

**Learnings:**
- GetFilteredTeamTasks uses query string arrays (`statuses[]=&statuses[]=`)
- BulkTimeInStatus uses repeated query params (`?task_ids=abc&task_ids=def`)
- Move task is v3 only - requires workspace ID via v3Path()
- Time-in-status returns minutes (not milliseconds)
- Must use static error variables (err113 linter)
- formatDuration in time_legacy.go takes milliseconds, needed separate formatMinutesToDuration for minutes

## Task 11 - 2026-02-22
### Completed: Extend Time Service (Timer + CRUD + Tags + History)

**What was implemented:**
- Extended `TimeService` with 11 new methods:
  - Get(ctx, teamID, entryID) - get single time entry
  - Current(ctx, teamID) - get running timer
  - Start(ctx, teamID, req) - start a new timer
  - Stop(ctx, teamID) - stop the running timer
  - Update(ctx, teamID, entryID, req) - update a time entry
  - Delete(ctx, teamID, entryID) - delete a time entry
  - History(ctx, teamID, entryID) - get time entry change history
  - ListTags(ctx, teamID) - list all time entry tags
  - AddTags(ctx, teamID, req) - add tags to entries
  - RemoveTags(ctx, teamID, req) - remove tags from entries
  - RenameTag(ctx, teamID, req) - rename a tag
- Added `DeleteWithBody` method to `api.Client` for DELETE requests with JSON body
- Added types: TimeEntryDetail, TimeEntryDetailResponse, StartTimeEntryRequest, UpdateTimeEntryRequest, TimeEntryTagsRequest, RenameTimeEntryTagRequest, TimeEntryHistoryResponse, TimeEntryHistoryItem, TimeEntryTag, TimeEntryTagsResponse
- Added CLI commands: time get, current, start, stop, update, delete, history, tags, add-tags, remove-tags, rename-tag
- Renamed formatDuration/formatTimestamp to formatLegacyDuration/formatLegacyTimestamp in time_legacy.go to avoid conflicts
- Added 23 comprehensive tests for all new service methods

**Files changed:**
- `internal/api/client.go` — added DeleteWithBody method
- `internal/clickup/client.go` — extended TimeService with all new methods
- `internal/clickup/types.go` — added all Time extension types
- `internal/clickup/client_test.go` — added 23 tests for new methods
- `internal/cmd/time.go` — added all new CLI commands with output formatting
- `internal/cmd/time_legacy.go` — renamed helper functions to avoid conflicts

**Branch:** `phase/9-p2-completeness`
**Commit:** `7caa1b6`
**PR URL:** (pending - will be added to existing PR)

**Learnings:**
- `json.Number` only accepts valid numeric strings - cannot use "entry-1" style IDs
- Running timer has negative duration convention: duration = -start_timestamp
- Tag operations use DELETE with request body (uncommon but supported)
- Start/Stop/Get/Current all return same TimeEntryDetail type
- Time entry IDs are numbers (not UUIDs like groups)
- The gocritic linter prefers `minutes %= 60` over `minutes = minutes % 60`

## Task 12 - 2026-02-22
### Completed: Create Tags Service

**What was implemented:**
- Created `TagsService` with 6 methods:
  - List(spaceID) - list all tags in a space
  - Create(spaceID, req) - create a new tag
  - Update(spaceID, tagName, req) - edit a tag
  - Delete(spaceID, tagName) - delete a tag
  - AddToTask(taskID, tagName) - add tag to task
  - RemoveFromTask(taskID, tagName) - remove tag from task
- Added types: SpaceTag, SpaceTagsResponse, CreateSpaceTagRequest, EditSpaceTagRequest
- Added CLI commands: tags list, create, update, delete, add, remove
- Added 12 comprehensive tests for all service methods

**Files changed:**
- `internal/clickup/client.go` — added TagsService with all methods
- `internal/clickup/types.go` — added SpaceTag types
- `internal/clickup/client_test.go` — added 12 tests for Tags service
- `internal/cmd/tags.go` — added all CLI commands
- `internal/cmd/root.go` — added Tags command to CLI struct

**Branch:** `phase/9-p2-completeness`
**Commit:** `267b28e`
**PR URL:** (pending - will be added to existing PR)

**Learnings:**
- Tag names in API paths use URL encoding (not tag IDs)
- Create/Edit endpoints wrap body in `{"tag": {...}}` envelope
- Adding a non-existent tag to a task creates it in the space
- Space tags have foreground (tag_fg) and background (tag_bg) colors
- Tag paths use tag name, not ID: `/v2/space/{space_id}/tag/{tag_name}`
